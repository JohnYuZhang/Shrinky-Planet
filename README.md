## Introduction
The goal of Shrinky Planet was to create a mobile game targeted at casual audiences. There
are several design principles to consider while creating a mobile game. This document will
outline some of these principles while evaluating the implementation and design choices.
“Less is more” is the underlying design principle for this project. Many mobile games such as
“Flappy Bird” employ simple mechanics to achieve significant results in gameplay, Shrinky
Planet attempts to apply the same principles from these games. **Note: This game was heavily
inspired by a project from Ludum Dare.** As this assignment is focused on the polish aspect of
the game, several improvements to the game were made.

## Gameplay
Shrinky Planet is a game where players drive around a spherical planet that is constantly
decreasing in size. Meteors spawn and crash on the planet which create craters that players
must avoid. Green diamonds also spawn on the planet for players to collect. Upon collection,
the planet will increase in size. The goal is to survive as long as possible and achieve the
best score.
## Menu
The menu consists of several elements including the Play, Quit, Next and Previous buttons
as well as a preview of the currently selected planet. The focus of the menu is to provide
players with a gateway to access the game. Several options such as customization and high
score are also pre-gameplay features that are included in the menu. Originally the menu only
had the Play and Quit buttons but options to change planets and display score were added
during the polishing stage of the game. The text colours for the UI items were also changed
to black for clarity as per player request. A theme overhaul was necessary after changing the
planet model.
Design Choice: Players are able to view their high score after the game but should also be
able to view it when the game is launched. The score display is a core component of this
game and is provided with clarity. Customization features are also provided prior to the start
of the game for obvious reasons.
## Score
The original scoring system was based on the size of the planet; the score displayed the size
the planet shrunk to when the player died/lost. This system was changed because the
growing mechanic was added (View Power Ups section). Planet size was no longer a valid
metric for determining skill as players had methods of increasing the planet size so the
scoring was changed to be based on time. Following the “less is more” approach, no further
metrics are provided. The score system enables players to attempt to beat their personal
high scores as well as challenge others’ scores. “Flappy Bird” became widespread through
people's’ competitive nature and this game seeks to recreate that. After several playtests
with friends, it appears to have been a success as many people played for more than 10
minutes in order to beat each other's high scores.
Design Choice: Time provides a consistent metric for measuring progression however,
through player testing, many people reported that distance is more meaningful in terms of
player satisfaction so the time is displayed as distance traveled in meters.
## Customization Features
Although the focus of this game is to be simplistic, customization features can add flavour
and variety without changing the underlying mechanics of the game. Throughout the
polishing phase of the game, a system to select the planet is provided. Avatar selection was
not implemented due to time constraints but is another aspect that can add player
individuality without changing the underlying principles of the game.
Design Choice: For part 3, different planets were added which had different properties such
as driving speed and different shrinking speeds and meteor spawn speeds but were
ultimately removed as it interfered with the underlying design principle of “less is more”.
Instead, different models for planets were added without changing its’ properties and
challenges.
## Player and Controls
The avatar moves at a constant speed around the planet without speeding up or slowing
down. Players have restricted control of the direction the car is going; the directional change
is static. This is essential in creating a “less is more” type of game. For reference, “Flappy
Bird”’s only control is tapping to fly.
Design Choice: The controls were intended to be restrictive to add a layer of depth and a
learning curve. For mobile games, simple controls are intuitive and required. Accelerometer
controls were experimented with but were discarded as they were unreliable. Instead, the
screen is divided into two halves that represent directional input (Simulated by “a” and “d”
keys).
## Obstacles
Meteors spawn 20 units away from the planet and get pulled towards to planet through
Unity’s Flux Gravity script. As they land on the planet, they create creators that players need
to avoid. Once struck, the game is over.
Several other obstacles were tested such as puddles of sludge that slow the avatar and
cracks that the player must jump over. These were ultimately removed as they added
unnecessary clutter and did not add enough depth.
Balls with physics enabled were tested to spawn instead of meteors. On impact with the
planet, they bounced and rolled around the planet. This could be included as another game
mode as it changed the dynamic of the game while maintaining the core mechanics of
avoiding obstacles.
Design Choice: Some obstacles were tested and removed because they created
unnecessary clutter. With one obstacle, the objective is clear; avoid meteors and craters.
## Power Ups
Originally the game did not have any way to recover so the average score was similar for all
players. The lack of a “grow” mechanic restricted players from achieving high scores past a
certain point as the planet would become too small to maneuver around craters. The green
diamond power up was introduced to provide more depth. These powerups spawn every
5-10 seconds randomly around the Planet. Upon collecting the power up, the planet would
grow by a set factor. Several restrictions were added to ensure that the planet would not
grow past it’s original size. If the planet is smaller than 50% of its original size, collecting a
power up will set the size back to 50%. If this were not implemented, an issue with skill cap
would be introduced as players would eventually lose regardless of how skilled they are.
Design Choice: Only the growth mechanic was added because it increases the skill range a
player can attain without over complicating the game.
Note: Several testers have noted that they did not initially notice the effects of collecting the
power up however, after several playthroughs and increases in player skill, they did notice
the planet growing.
## Conclusion
The focus of this project was to add depth and polish to a game while maintaining a simple
“less is more” approach targeted towards casual mobile gamers. This was achieved by
providing customization without changing any mechanics and maintaining a simple control
scheme. Depth was added through the inclusion of the “growth” mechanic to allow for
potentially infinite gameplay.
